# Selenium Smooth Scrolling with Python

## Overview

This Python script uses Selenium WebDriver to automate smooth scrolling on a webpage. The script mimics human-like behavior by scrolling the page down by a random offset and pausing for a random amount of time before scrolling again.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- ChromeDriver (or any other WebDriver compatible with your browser)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Selenium WebDriver using pip:
    ```
    pip install selenium
    ```
3. Download ChromeDriver from [ChromeDriver's official website](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and add it to your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the script is located.
3. Run the script:
    ```
    python script_name.py
    ```

## Code Explanation

- The script first initializes a Selenium WebDriver instance and navigates to the target webpage.
- A random number between 5 and 10 is generated to determine the number of times the page will be scrolled.
- A loop iterates for the generated number of times, performing the following actions:
  - A random offset between 100 and 500 pixels is generated.
  - The page is scrolled down smoothly by the random offset using JavaScript.
  - A random delay between 1 and 5 seconds is generated.
  - The script pauses for the random delay before the next iteration.
